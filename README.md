Thank you for making my life easier.

#macOS setup

Simple bash script to set up some core settings in macOS to my liking. There are some gaps that I have not bothered to take care of.


### What this does do:

Locale settings, some minor ui stuff, and installing packages I use frequently.

### What this does not do:

There are very many OSX settings that would be complex to set with a script. In order to minimize these problematic settings, I have mostly installed my core packages and settings that I need to operate my computer effectively.


It is still necessary for me to go through my settings menu and set some things manually. Most of what I could forget is set by the script or documented in screenshots. The only missing link is some minor finder settings:

* What folder to open when you open finder.
* What things to hide from the menu bar.

Some spotlight preferences:

* Disabling dictionary.
* Disabling web.
* Disabling services I dont use.

Some desktop preferences:

* Making the icons a smidge smaller.

One users preference:

* Remove guest user.

Enabling mouse gestures:

* Just enable all of them. EZ.

AAAAAND I suppose my wallpapers.



If I find simple preferences I can edit for these. I will. Trackpad ones were fairly simple, but I want to revise what I like now that I have force touch.



Cheers,

Salomon
